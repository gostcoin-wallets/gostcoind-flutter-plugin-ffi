## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Follow the [Add C and C++ code to your project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code) instructions in the Android docs to add native code and support for the native code toolchain (either CMake or `ndk-build`).
